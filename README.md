# skidnomore3000
Skidnomore3000 is an interactive tool I wrote as a complete meme on a Monday morning after someone in Discord chat asked if using pre-built tools makes you a "script kiddie."  Of course it doesn't, and shame on organizations like CompTIA for pepetuating this derogatory term.  We all use pre-built tools.  Don't feel bad about it.
